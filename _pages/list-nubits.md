**List our stable cryptocurrencies and give your traders access to the benefits of NuBits. Include NuShares for investors with minimal additional effort.**

Set up NuBits as pairs with xxNBT as denominator to attract most traders. They're accustomed to using BTC/USD (or BTC/CNY), and our currency US NuBits is pegged to the US dollar, making BTC/USNBT far more intuitive. SouthXchange is an excellent reference.

We will provide peg-supporting liquidity at exchanges where NuBits is paired with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or US dollar. Our spread is always below or equal to 1%, and includes the exchange fee for everyone's convenience. Our price feeds are averages of aggregated sources.
