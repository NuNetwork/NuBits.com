NuShares is the stock and backbone reserve for NuBits.

Shareholders can vote on motions and grants to steer the future of NuBits. New NuShares are created only by shareholders voting on and passing a custodial grant for NSR, or from voting reward (minting).

A minimum of 10,000 NuShares is required to submit votes on the network. This limit is in place to prevent blockchain clutter from individuals without a vested interest in the network, while still allowing small shareholders to offer input into network decisions.

Shareholders can cast Custodian votes, Park Rate votes, Motion votes, and votes for Transaction Fees. Each time a shareholder mints a block, their votes are recorded in the blockchain.
