## Technology

The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). From their website: Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

To learn more about managing content in Jekyll, refer to the [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

## Development

To run the site locally:

```
[~] cd /path/to/repo
[~] jekyll serve
```

If you're having trouble, be sure that you are meeting all of the [requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

## Deployment

The `master` branch is used for GitHub Pages.

1. Create a pull request from `my-feature-branch` to `master`.
2. Get another developer to review it.
3. Merge it to push the code live.
